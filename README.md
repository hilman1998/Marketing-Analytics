# Marketing Clustering with K-means

## Project Overview
This project applies the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their marketing data. The objective is to identify distinct groups within the customer base to tailor marketing strategies more effectively. This analysis is carried out using a K-means model in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
- **Data Segmentation**: Implementing K-means to segment customer data into meaningful groups.
- **Optimal Clustering**: Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing clusters for better understanding and insight derivation.
- **Customer Profiling**: Profiling each cluster to identify key characteristics and behaviors.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Providing strategic insights for targeted marketing approaches.

## Key Skills Utilized
- **Cluster Analysis**: Proficient use of K-means for customer segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating plots to visualize data distributions and clustering results.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for clustering.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Leveraging Jupyter Notebook for iterative data analysis and reporting.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Evaluating clustering performance and interpreting statistical data.
